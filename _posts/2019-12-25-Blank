## Apex Testing Related

### How can we organize test data that is used across test cases?

## Other Notes

[Build a Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
[Get Started With Bitnami Applications Using VirtualBox](https://docs.bitnami.com/virtual-machine/get-started-virtualbox/)

Restarting Jenkins from command line:

```java -jar ./jenkins-cli.jar -auth <username>:<password> -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins safe-restart```

## Getting Jenkins started

* Install Tomcat version 8.5+, by uninstalling debian version to directory of my choice (```/opt```)
* Copy jenkins.war to the webapps
* In Tomcat conf directory, edit tomcat-users.xml to add users and permissions/roles
* Since, this needs to be accessed (manager app), enable the remote access to the app by editing and providing anonymous access in ```manager-app/META-INF/context.xml```
* Start the tomcat server by ```startup.sh```

## Configuring VirtualBox as a separate machine with different network

* Configured Host Networking machine to create additional network interface
* Use this interface to attach with the newly created VM, i.e. Host-Only VM
* This helps you to reach to this machine as a different IP and port

## Jenkins plugins problem

Following error didn't go away --

* Problem with reverse proxy not working
* Possibly the internet traffic from Virtual Box is not able to reach out to internet directly causing this problem
