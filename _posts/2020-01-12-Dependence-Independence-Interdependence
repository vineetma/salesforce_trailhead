Dependence is the initial state of every human being when he is child and as he graduates towards adult,
he/she gains lot of independence. However, what differentiates one from other is the amount of this
independence and how is this independence used in social context. 

A person is socially acceptable, when he enters the realm of inter-dependence. Where he is dependent on others
and others are equally dependent on him/her. This is only possible, when the two interacting entities are
independent. 

To be independent, one needs to gain strengths that are useful for others. Is it possible to gain strengths
that are threatening to the society and you are acceptable. I guess no, unless dictatorship is acceptable
norm. When one strength is used by other, it moves a person from independence to inter-dependence.

Through one's life, one need to evolve to state of being useful for the society and stay relevant through
constant hardwork, gaining new skills, capabilities. Being socially acceptable is one of the critical
elements to have satisfaction and feeling of achievement in life.
