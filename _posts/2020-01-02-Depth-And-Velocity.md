## Summary

If you create a porous surface and allow the water to flow on top of it. There are some interesting observations or we can call law of nature observed. Faster this water flows, lesser is the depth of wet surface, for a given period of time. This is something we would have read during our school days. Point I want to drive to is that if we try to move faster, no matter what, the depth of the work, which may often be qualified with quality and necessary detail, is missed.

Lets try to correlate this with the way information flows today in digital world and it is corroding the depth and retention of useful information, impacting everyone.

I recently, thought to start using Digital Wellbeing application to validate the common notion that average time spent by humans on mobile today has significantly increased. Wanted to check it on myself. I was shocked to see, that I spent more than 4 hours on mobile, being topped by YouTube, Whatsapp. While I do so, I was constantly complaining about shortage of time to meet in person people, exercise, sleep.
